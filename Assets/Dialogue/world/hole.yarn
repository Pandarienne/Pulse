<<if $hole_patched == false>>
    There's an open hole in the wall. It's leaking water. Oh no!
    <<if $has_tools>>
        -> Fix Hole.
            The hole is now patched up. Still leaking, but it'll hold. 
            <<set $hole_patched = true>>

<<else>>
    It was a hole on the wall, but you patched it up. Go you!
